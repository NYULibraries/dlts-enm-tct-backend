!!! note "A Note on Terminology"
    You may notice the terms __basket__ and __hit__ a lot on this page.  Internally, this is how our topic mapping software refers to __topics__ and __names__, respectively.  In almost all cases, mentally replacing __basket__ with __topic__ and __hit__ with __name__ will work perfectly.

## All Topics

Gives a list of all topics in the system:

```
/api/hit/basket/all/
```

### Example response

```json
[
    {
        "id": 3037,
        "display_name": "17 U.S.C. ยง120(a)"
    },
    {
        "id": 30823,
        "display_name": "1950s"
    },
    ...
    {
        "id": 22291,
        "display_name": "Zwerdling, Alex"
    },
    {
        "id": 25992,
        "display_name": "Zwingli, Huldreich"
    }
]
```

### Field Descriptions

Field         | Type    | Description
------------- | ------- | -----------
id            | Integer | Internal id and primary identifier for each topic
display_name  | String  | Primary name for the topic. Can be changed by hiding, deleting, editing, or preferring names on the topic in question.

---

## Topic Subset

This endpoints allows you to get lists of topics by either starting letter or document. For example:

```
/api/hit/basket/search/?letter=B
```

Will give all topics whose `display_name` starts with the letter 'B'.  In order to get all topics that start with a number or symbol, us the '#' sign:

```
/api/hit/basket/search/?letter=#
```

To get a list of topics in a given document, use:

```
/api/hit/basket/search/?document=DOCUMENT_ID
```

to get the id of a given document, use the [sources API](sources.md) or the editorial interface.  The structure/fields of the response are the same as the [All Topics](#all-topics) endpoint.

---

## Topic Detail

Gives all data for a single topic, including all names, occurrences, and relations:

```
/api/hit/basket/BASKET_ID
```

```
/api/review/basket/all/
```

### Example Response

```json
[
    {
        "id": 3037,
        "display_name": "17 U.S.C. ยง120(a)",
        "review": {
            "reviewer": null,
            "time": null,
            "reviewed": false,
            "changed": false
        }
    },
    {
        "id": 30823,
        "display_name": "1950s",
        "review": {
            "reviewer": null,
            "time": null,
            "reviewed": false,
            "changed": false
        }
    },
    ...
   {
        "id": 25992,
        "display_name": "Zwingli, Huldreich",
        "review": {
            "reviewer": "Alex",
            "time": "2017-01-05T21:16:03.377185Z",
            "reviewed": true,
            "changed": false
        }
    }
]
```

### Field Descriptions

Field            | Type    | Description
---------------- | ------- | -----------
id               | Integer | Internal id and primary identifier for each topic
display_name     | String  | Primary name for the topic. Can be changed by hiding, deleting, editing, or preferring names on the topic in question.
review.reviewer  | String  | Username of person who last changed the review status of topic
review.time      | String  | Date/Time of last change of review status, in UTC format
review.reviewed  | Boolean | Whether or not the topic was reviewed
review.changed   | Boolean | Whether the topic was changed (if reviewed)

---

### Reviewed Topic Subset

Provides the same subsets of topics as the [regular Topic Subset](#topic-subset) list, except also includes review information. Query string parameters work exactly the same way -- for example, requesting all topics that start with letter 'D' (along with their review status) would be:

```
/api/review/basket/search/?letter=D
```

Field data is exactly the same as the [All Topics with Reviewed Data](#topics-with-review) API endpoint

---

## All Names

Returns a list of all names in the database:

```
/api/hit/hits/all/
```

### Example Response

```json
[
    {
        "name": "10 Percent",
        "basket": 38574,
        "scope": "Generic",
        "preferred": false,
        "hidden": false,
        "id": 40302
    },
    {
        "name": "17 U.S.C. ยง120(a)",
        "basket": 3037,
        "scope": "Generic",
        "preferred": false,
        "hidden": false,
        "id": 3109
    },
    ...
    {
        "name": "Zwingli, Huldreich",
        "basket": 25992,
        "scope": "Generic",
        "preferred": false,
        "hidden": false,
        "id": 26982
    }
]
```

### Field Descriptions

Field            | Type    | Description
---------------- | ------- | -----------
name             | String  | full, human-readable name
basket           | Integer | ID of the topic that this name is attached to
scope            | String  | scope name of the name
preferred        | Boolean | Indicates whether this is the preferred name of its topic
hidden           | Boolean | Indicates whether the name is hidden
id               | Integer | Internal ID of the name

---

## Names Subset

Get a list of names by certain characteristics, including starting letter, containing a search term, filtered by type, or filtered by scope.  This works very similar to the filtering [by topic](#topic-subset), so getting all names that start with a number or symbol would be:

```
/api/hit/hits/search/?letter=#
```

However, the name filtering also includes a few additional options, including finding any case-insensitive substring within the name. For example, the query

```
/api/hit/hists/search/?name="adams"
```

Would include all names that contain _adams_, whether or not it was at the begining (e.g. it would return both _Henry Adams_ and _adams apple_).

!!! Note 
    In its current iteration, this endpoint requires exact string matches.  So while the above request would include _adams apple_, it would __not__ return _adam's apple_, due to the apostrophe preventing the exact string match.  

The Names Subset enpoints can also filter names by scope, so any name with a given scope can be found with 

```
/api/hit/hits/search/?scope=SCOPE_ID
```

Where __SCOPE_ID__ is the internal id of the given scope.  It's also worth noting that these various filters can be chained together, so the API query

```
/api/hit/hits/search/?letter=A&name=justice
```

Would return all names that start with the letter A and contains the (case-insensitive) string "justice".

For the structure of the response, see the [All Names](#all-names) API endpoint.

## All Scopes

```
/api/hit/scope/all/
```
